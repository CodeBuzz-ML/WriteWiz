**Question 5**<br>
Write word equations and then balanced equations for the reaction taking place when<br>
(a) dilute sulphuric acid reacts with zinc granules<br>
(b) dilute hydrochloric acid reacts with magnesium ribbon<br>
(c) dilute sulphuric acid reacts with aluminium powder<br>
(d) dilute hydrochloric acid reacts with iron filing<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
(a) Zinc + dilute sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen<br>
Zn (s) + H2SO4 (aq) → ZnSO4 (aq) + H2 (g)<br><br>

(b) Magnesium ribbon + dil. Hydrochloric acid → Magnesium chloride + Hydrogen<br>
Mg (s) + 2 HCl (aq) → MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)<br><br>

(c) Aluminium powder + dil. Sulphuric acid → Aluminium sulphate + Hydrogen<br>
2Al (s) + 3H2SO4 (aq) → Al2(SO4)3 (aq) + 3H2 (g)<br><br>

(d) Iron filings + Dilute hydrochloric acid → Ferric chloride + Hydrogen<br>
2Fe (s) + 6HCl (aq) → 2FeCl3 (aq) + 3H2 (g)<br><br>

**Question 6**<br>
Compounds such as alcohol and glucose also contain hydrogen but are not categorised as acids. Describe an activity to prove it.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
Though compounds like alcohol and glucose contain hydrogen, they do not ionise in the solution to produce H+ ions on passing current through them.<br>
(i) Take solutions of alcohols and glucose.<br>
(ii) Fix two nails on a cork, and place the cork in 100 mL beaker.<br>
(iii) Connect the nails to the two terminals of a 6 volt battery through a bulb and a switch.<br>
(iv) Now pour alcohol in the beaker and switch on the current.<br>
(v) The bulb does not glow.<br>
(vi) Repeat the experiment with glucose. The bulb does not glow in this case also.<br>
(vii) This means no ions or H+ ions are present in the solution.<br>
This shows that alcohols and glucose are not acids.<br><br>

**Question 7**<br>
Why does distilled water not conduct electricity, whereas rainwater does?<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
Distilled water does not conduct electricity because it does not contain any ionic compound (like acids, bases or salts) dissolved in it.<br>
Rainwater, while falling to the earth through the atmosphere, dissolves an acidic gas carbon dioxide from the air and forms carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid provides hydrogen ions, H+ (aq) and carbonate ions, CO3^2– (aq) to rainwater. Hence, due to the presence of carbonic acid which provides ions to rainwater, the rainwater conducts electricity.<br><br>

**Question 8**<br>
Why do acids not show acidic behaviour in the absence of water?<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
The acidic behaviour of acids is due to the presence of hydrogen ions, [H+ (aq) ions], in them. The acid produces hydrogen ions only in the presence of water. So in the absence of water, an acid will not form hydrogen ions and hence will not show its acidic behaviour.<br><br>

**Question 9**<br>
Five solutions A, B, C, D and E when tested with universal indicator showed pH as 4, 1, 11, 7 and 9 respectively. Which solution is<br>
(a) Neutral<br>
(b) Strongly alkaline<br>
(c) Strongly acidic<br>
(d) Weakly acidic<br>
(e) Weakly alkaline<br>
Arrange the pH in increasing order of hydrogen ion concentration.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
(a) D<br>
(b) C<br>
(c) B<br>
(d) A<br>
(e) E<br><br>

Increasing order of hydrogen ion concentration:<br>
11 < 9 < 7 < 4 < 1<br>
i.e., C < E < D < A < B<br><br>

**Question 10**<br>
Equal lengths of magnesium ribbons are taken in test tubes A and B. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to test tube A, while acetic acid (CH3COOH) is added to test tube B. In which test tube will the fizzing occur more vigorously and why?<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
Fizzing will occur more vigorously in test tube A. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid whereas acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid. Being a strong acid, the hydrochloric acid solution contains a much greater amount of hydrogen ions, which leads to more vigorous fizzing in test tube A (containing hydrochloric acid). The fizzing is due to the evolution of hydrogen gas which is formed by the action of acid on the magnesium metal of the magnesium ribbon.<br><br>

**Question 11**<br>
Fresh milk has a pH of 6. How do you think the pH will change as it turns into curd? Explain your answer.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
The pH of milk falls below 6 as it turns into curd due to the formation of lactic acid during this process. Lactic acid present in it reduces its pH value.<br><br>

**Question 12**<br>
A milkman adds a very small amount of baking soda to fresh milk.<br>
(a) Why does he shift the pH of the fresh milk from 6 to slightly alkaline?<br>
(b) Why does this milk take a long time to set as curd?<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
(a) Milk is made slightly alkaline so that it may not get sour easily due to the formation of lactic acid in it.<br>
(b) The alkaline milk takes a longer time to set into curd because the lactic acid being formed has to first neutralise the alkali present in it.<br><br>

**Question 13**<br>
Plaster of Paris should be stored in a moisture proof container. Explain why?<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
Plaster of Paris should be stored in a moisture proof container because the presence of moisture can cause slow setting of plaster of Paris by bringing about its hydration. This will make the plaster of Paris useless after some time.<br><br>

**Question 14**<br>
What is a neutralisation reaction? Give two examples.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
The reaction between an acid and a base to form salt and water is called a neutralisation reaction.<br>
Examples:<br>
(i) HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)<br>
(ii) H2SO4 (aq) + 2KOH (aq) → K2SO4 (aq) + 2H2O (l)<br><br>

**Question 15**<br>
Give two important uses of washing soda and baking soda.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
Uses of washing soda:<br>
(i) Washing soda is used in glass, soap and paper industries.<br>
(ii) It is used for removing permanent hardness of water.<br><br>

Uses of baking soda:<br>
(i) Baking soda is used as an antacid in medicines to remove acidity of the stomach.<br>
(ii) Baking soda is used for making baking powder (used in making cakes, bread, etc.).<br>
