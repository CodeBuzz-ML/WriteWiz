**Question 9**<br>
What does one mean by exothermic and endothermic reactions? Give examples.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
Exothermic reactions: Those reactions in which heat is evolved are known as exothermic reactions. An exothermic reaction is indicated by writing “+ Heat” on the products side of an equation.<br>
Example:<br>
(i) C (s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + Heat<br>
(ii) N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) → 2NH3 (g) + Heat<br><br>

Endothermic reactions: Those reactions in which heat is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions. An endothermic reaction is usually indicated by writing “Heat” on the product side of a chemical equation.<br>
Examples:<br>
(i) C (s) + 2S (s) → CS2 (l) + Heat<br>
(ii) N2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2NO (g) + Heat<br><br>

**Question 10**<br>
Why is respiration considered an exothermic reaction? Explain.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
Respiration is an exothermic process because during respiration, glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body to form carbon dioxide and water along with the production of energy.<br><br>

**Question 11**<br>
Why are decomposition reactions called the opposite of combination reactions? Write equations for these reactions.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
In a decomposition reaction, a single compound breaks down to produce two or more simpler substances.<br>
For example:<br>
2HgO (s) → 2Hg (l) + O2 (g)<br><br>

While in a combination reaction, two or more substances simply combine to form a new substance.<br>
For example:<br>
2H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2H2O (l)<br><br>

**Question 12**<br>
Write one equation each for the decomposition reactions where energy is supplied in the form of heat, light, or electricity.<br>
OR<br>
Decomposition reactions require energy either in the form of heat or light or electricity for breaking down the reactants. Write one equation each for decomposition reactions where energy is supplied in the form of heat, light, and electricity.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
Decomposition reaction with heat:<br>
2HgO (s) → 2Hg (l) + O2 (g)<br><br>

Decomposition reaction with light:<br>
2AgBr (s) → 2Ag (s) + Br2 (g) (light)<br><br>

Decomposition reaction with electricity:<br>
2H2O (l) → 2H2 (g) + O2 (g) (electricity)<br><br>

**Question 13**<br>
What is the difference between displacement and double displacement reactions? Write equations for these reactions.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
In displacement reactions, a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its solution. For example:<br>
Fe (s) + CuSO4 (aq) → Cu (s) + FeSO4 (aq)<br>
This is a displacement reaction where iron displaces copper from its solution.<br><br>

In double displacement reactions, two reactants in solution exchange their ions. For example:<br>
AgNO3 (aq) + NaCl (aq) → AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)<br>
This is a double displacement reaction where silver nitrate and sodium chloride exchange Cl– and NO3– ions between them.<br><br>

**Question 14**<br>
In the refining of silver, the recovery of silver from silver nitrate solution involved displacement by copper metal. Write down the reaction involved.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
The reaction is:<br>
2AgNO3 (aq) + Cu (s) → 2Ag (s) + Cu(NO3)2 (aq)<br><br>

**Question 15**<br>
What do you mean by a precipitation reaction? Explain by giving examples.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
A reaction in which an insoluble solid called precipitate is formed that separates from the solution is called a precipitation reaction.<br>
Example: When a solution of iron (III) chloride and ammonium hydroxide are mixed, a brown precipitate of iron (III) hydroxide is formed:<br>
FeCl3 (aq) + 3NH4OH (aq) → Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3NH4Cl (aq)<br><br>

**Question 16**<br>
Explain the following in terms of gain or loss of oxygen with two examples each:<br>
(a) Oxidation and<br>
(b) Reduction.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
(a) Oxidation: The addition of oxygen to a substance is called oxidation.<br>
Example:<br>
(i) S (s) + O2 (g) → SO2 (g) (Addition of oxygen to sulfur)<br>
(ii) 2Mg (s) + O2 (g) → 2MgO (s) (Addition of oxygen to magnesium)<br><br>

(b) Reduction: The removal of oxygen from a substance is called reduction.<br>
Example:<br>
(i) CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O (Here, copper oxide is being reduced to copper because oxygen gets removed from copper oxide.)<br>
(ii) ZnO + C → Zn + CO (Here, zinc oxide is being reduced to zinc because oxygen gets removed from zinc oxide.)<br><br>

**Question 17**<br>
A shiny brown coloured element ‘X’ on heating in air becomes black in colour. Name the element ‘X’ and the black coloured compound formed.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
Element ‘X’ is copper (Cu).<br>
The black coloured compound is copper oxide (CuO). The reaction involved is:<br>
2Cu (s) + O2 (g) → 2CuO (s)<br><br>

**Question 18**<br>
Why do we apply paint on iron articles?<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
Paint does not allow iron articles to come in contact with air and water and saves iron articles from damage due to rusting.<br><br>

**Question 19**<br>
Oil and fat containing food items are flushed with nitrogen. Why?<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
To keep food items fresh and save them from getting oxidized, food items are flushed with nitrogen.<br><br>

**Question 20**<br>
Explain the following terms with one example each:<br>
(a) Corrosion<br>
(b) Rancidity.<br><br>

**Answer:**<br>
(a) Corrosion: It is the process in which metals are eaten up gradually by the action of air, moisture, or a chemical (such as an acid) on their surface.<br>
Example: When iron is exposed to moist air for a long period of time, its surface acquires a coating of a brown, flaky substance called rust. Rust is mainly hydrated iron (III) oxide [Fe2O3.xH2O].<br><br>

(b) Rancidity: The condition produced by aerial oxidation of fats and oils in foods marked by unpleasant smell and taste is called rancidity.<br>
Rancidity spoils the food materials prepared in fats and oils which have been kept for a considerable time and makes them unfit for eating.<br>
Rancidity can be prevented by adding anti-oxidants to foods containing fats and oils. It can also be prevented by flushing fat and oil containing foods with nitrogen before sealing.<br>
